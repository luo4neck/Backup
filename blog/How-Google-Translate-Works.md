I had been thinking about how translation websites work for days and discussed with some friends. However when I searched about the result, I got a different answer. 

The idea of Google: 
The link below was uploaded to youtube by Google to explain the basic theory of Google Translate. When a sentence was given to the dialog, Google Translate even dont know the exactly meaning of the sentence but the translation result could be generated from statistical data (big data wow). The disadvantage of this algorithm is when a pair of nature languages have very rich translation texts to be analyzed, the machine translation result would be much more accurate than a pair with limited texts. Maybe for the pair without rich texts, my idea could be a solution.

My idea:
I had explored (not learning) some features of Sanskrit, which in my understanding is the official version of an ancient India language (Pali is the secular version which is spoken by Buddha and his fellows). Some features of Sanskrit are similar with Latin, like complex grammar, rigorous structure, Indo-European Family and used as kind of religion language today.

Sanskrit had been considered by some computer scientists to be used as 'meta-language' for machine translation because of its rigorous feature (even more rigorous than Latin). But this idea is not used by Google Translate today, the reason and current research is not what I want to search.

What I thought was: since programming language is more rigorous than nature languages, is it possible to construct a computer-middle-language system to express all possible nature expressions for machine translation? All nature sentences are translated into the constructed computer-middle-language and then translated again into a sentence of the target language. This is a very straightforward idea and the disadvantages are very obvious, the complexity parts like ambiguous meaning and polysemant would be difficult to be dealt by the computer-middle-language. 


/* ==================================================================================  */

After all, the 2 languages (English and Chinese) I can use are both used by more than billion people, this made my limitation because in both languages a particular meaning could be expressed in multi ways. Maybe a language of only millions of users is an other picture and probably I would never know that.

Next blog will talk about Database.
